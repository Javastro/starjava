14 Feb 2005 (Mark Taylor):
The JEL version supplied with JSky was 0.9.5.  This clashes with the
version used in TTOOLS (previously TOPCAT).  So I have replaced
the one here with the later version 0.9.11.  From the JEL homepage
it looks like this is unlikely to result in problems.

Upgrade JEL to 2.0.2.
