StarJava Alternative Build
==========

This site is the documentation from an alternative build of the Starjava software
using [maven](http://maven.apache.org/).

The purpose of this site is not to generate the official starjava applications 
(e.g. Topcat), 
but rather to create a set of reusable jars for the component libraries that make
up these applications.

The official starjava distribution can be obtained from http://dev.starlink.ac.uk/
