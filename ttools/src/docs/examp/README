The files in this directory have been auto-generated, and then checked
into the source archive.  There are two reasons that they are not
generated as part of the normal build process:

   - they rely on large external data files that ought not to get
     checked into a source archive

   - the graphics file generation can be time consuming

There are two sets of files here, generated by different classes:

   plot2-*:
      A fairly comprehensive set of example plots for the different
      available plot layers, shading modes etc in the plot2 framework.
      They are mostly png files, but a couple of text manifests too.
      Generated by the class uk.ac.starlink.ttools.build.Plot2Example,
      using the ant target plot2-examples.
      Should be regenerated from time to time.

   others:
      Some miscellaneous screenshots associated with old-style plotting.
      Generated by the class uk.ac.starlink.ttools.build.PlotExample,
      using the ant target plot-examples.
      Basically obsolete, probably will not be updated.
